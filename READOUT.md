The BeJu™ (Bergmann Junk) test apparatus is used for the determination of the chemical stability of firearm and rocket propellants by the qualitative analysis of gaseous products evolved during the thermal decomposition of a sample. The sample is heated in a heavy, aluminum heating block at 120 or 132 °C.  Gaseous products evolved during the thermal decomposition are absorbed into a glass adaptor filled with water. The amount of gaseous products is then determined by quantitative volumetric analysis of the resulting aqueous solution. The typical sample mass is 5g and the measured temperature ranges between 120 - 132 with a testing period between up to 6 hours.
