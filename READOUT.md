The BeJu™ (Bergmann Junk) test apparatus is used for the determination of the chemical stability of firearm and rocket propellants by the qualitative analysis of gaseous products evolved during the thermal decomposition of a sample. The sample is heated in a heavy, aluminum heating block at 120 or 132 °C.  Gaseous products evolved during the thermal decomposition are absorbed into a glass adaptor filled with water. The amount of gaseous products is then determined by quantitative volumetric analysis of the resulting aqueous solution. The typical sample mass is 5g and the measured temperature ranges between 120 - 132 with a testing period between up to 6 hours.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum
